# Deployment


## Description
Our games obsessed manager has a nice little side project for you: vizualize some interesting aspects about his poorly scraped steam data. He's managed to compile a json file containing data on some 1000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront steam.

He'd like us to show him a proof of concept to translate data, visualize said data and deploy a little server so he can see if it is worth investing more time in.
